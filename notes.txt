Suggestions for improving the model
    Could benefit from dropout for reducing overfitting
    Cosine decay seems to be doing well, we need to redo though with the correct piecewise decay to compare
    Try larger training size with variable resolutions and aspect ratios
    Compare the model with the results from the paper on the Urban100 dataset
    rename 'Train_subimages' to 'Train_subimages_x2'


Todo for comparing our model to the base model
    Will be using the Urban100 dataset
    Confirm that the model type that we are using is the one that was used in the paper by checking PSNR and SSIM
    Train our own model on the NTIRE dataset

    load the dataset
    run on the dataset
